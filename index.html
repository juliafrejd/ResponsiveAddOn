          <h2>Why analog photography?</h2>
          <h3>Analog photography, the authentic aesthetic</h3>
          <p>
            Like vinyl, typewriters and other analog tech, film has an enduring,
            authentic appeal and is making a comeback among professionals and
            amateurs alike. Shooting with film isn’t that different from
            digital. Photographers still control their work by manipulating the
            holy trinity of exposure: shutter speed, aperture and ISO
            sensitivity — they just do it manually instead of relying on digital
            tools to optimize these factors automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            One big disparity? They can’t immediately check and adjust their
            work on the camera screen. But while film might make the process a
            little slower, many photographers argue there’s something romantic
            about that. Along with the creative possibilities — and constraints
            — that come with film, its low-fi, real-world aesthetic also appeals
            to photographers. There’s surely something special about that dreamy
            vintage veneer you often associate with family photo albums and
            hand-scrawled captions.
